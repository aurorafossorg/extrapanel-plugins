# Plugins

Plugin repository of both offical and community plugins/packs.

## Structure of repository

- **official** - Folder containing the collection of official plugins
- **community** - Folder containing the collection of community plugins
- **packs** - Folder containing collection of packs of plugins

## Types

**Official** - Plugins that were either developed by the core team or trusted users. These plugins are reviewed by us and safe to use.
**Community** - Plugins developed by other users added to this repository. These plugins are reviewed but not maintained by us.
**Others** - Plugins that were added from external sources. The user is responsible for using potentially dangerous plugins.

## What are packs?

Packs are just lists of plugins for the user to install. They're useful to bundle a bunch of plugins in a simple package for the end-user.
