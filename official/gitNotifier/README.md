# ![icon](assets/icon.png)Git Notifier

Show notifications from Git providers.

## Configuration

### Github

You'll need to create your own **personal access token** following the [official instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line), or you can use and already existing one. The only permission this plugin needs is **notifications**.

After that just copy/paste the token to the plugin's configuration menu and you're good to go.
